# "Cloudiness Estimation in Images Using VGG16: A Data-Driven Approach

# INTRODUCTION

<p align="justify"> In this paper, we present a novel approach to estimate cloudiness in images using a specially curated dataset derived from the publicly available Transient Attribute Dataset. Our model aims to predict cloudiness confidence levels—categorized into less cloudy, partially cloudy, and more cloudy—based on input images. By employing a pretrained VGG16 model, we achieved approximately 60% accuracy on our validation dataset. The regression output provides a continuous prediction of cloudiness confidence, while classification tasks yield discrete labels. This data-driven approach allows for simultaneous representation learning and label discretization, resulting in more accurate and reliable cloudiness prediction compared to traditional methods.</p>
